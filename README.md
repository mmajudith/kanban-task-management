## Overview

### The challenge

This is a solution to a fullstack project (Kanban task management) challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/kanban-task-management-web-app-wgQLt-HlbB) (they provide the design and assets and the gaol is to produce an app).

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser
